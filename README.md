# titanic-survivor

This is my very-first machine learning project using Python. 
I learned about data understanding, data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning through this.

My goal was to predict whether the titanic passangers are going to survive or not.
I used Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch and PClass as main variables, and random forest algorithm as model. 

As the result, the model have an accuracy about 84.7% where 283 passangers are not going to survive and 135 passangers going to survive.
